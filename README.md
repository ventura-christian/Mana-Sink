## 🚀 Why This Exists

As a developer and Magic the Gathering enthusiast, I wanted to create a hands-on project that brings **web development fundamentals** to life through a game I thoroughly enjoy. This project is built from the ground up to reinforce core full-stack dev skills while solving a real, personal problem: deck clutter, organization, and creation.
