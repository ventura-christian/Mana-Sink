## 🧙‍♂️ Mana Sink

Welcome to **Mana Sink** — a lightweight, browser-based tool designed for Magic: The Gathering players who want a clean, focused way to search cards or track their favorite decks. Whether you're brewing a spicy Commander list or tuning a Standard meta-breaker, this tool is your first step into a smarter battlefield. Users can search for cards, add them to decks, track mana curvves, save decks to their profile, and analyze performance or legality - all powered by React on the front-end and MongoDB/Express/Node on the back-end.

## ✨ Features (Planned)

- 📚 **Deck Organization** – Easily create, edit, and delete multiple MTG decks.
- 🧩 **Card Display Layout** – Intuitive card layout system for fast readability.
- 🔍 **Search & Filter** – Find cards or decks by name, type, color, or custom tags.
- 🧠 **Built for Customization** – Designed for expandability, including formats like Commander, Pauper, or Cube.
- 🧪 **Modern Web Stack** – Built from scratch using semantic HTML5, CSS3, and eventually JavaScript/Node.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

As a developer and Magic the Gathering enthusiast, I wanted to create a hands-on project that brings **web development fundamentals** to life through a game I thoroughly enjoy. This project is built from the ground up to reinforce core full-stack dev skills while solving a real, personal problem: deck clutter, organization, and creation.
